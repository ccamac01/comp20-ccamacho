# COMP20: Web Programming
## Christopher Camacho

#### 1) What is this purpose of this Git repository? (duh!)  
The purpose of this Git repository is to display my work over the past semester
in the class, COMP20: Web Programming. Here you will find links to all of the
files I worked with on all of my assignments, along with a README for every
assignment explaining the purpose of the assignment and comments.

#### 2)What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?  
My favorite assignment was assignment 2, involving the google maps api. This
assignment made me feel confident that I can work on a project on my own, being
able to incorporate multiple tools to develop a working application. Of course,
I still had/have much to learn, but that assignment made me very excited to be
working on web applications. Being able to implement API's in my code was
something I was very excited to learn about.  

#### 3)How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?  
I have grown significantly since day 1. I did not know a thing about how the
web works, how servers work, and how security affects web applications every day.
I did not know a thing about JavaScript nor Heroku. Being able to learn these tools
was very fun, and I hope that I can continue to work on a project in my free time,
now that I can run code locally and setup my own server.

#### 4)What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.
The most important thing I learned in this course was setting up a server to
work on a web app locally. For example, I ran a python server via terminal to
load my website for assignment 2. Then we got into nodejs and express which was
another way to serve a page locally. Lastly, we learned how to push our apps to
Heroku, where we were able to access our web page via unique Heroku URL.

#### 5)Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?
The ending of the class was great, I'm very excited about learning more about
security. After this class I hope I can delve deeper into the cyber security
field. I want to learn about security engineering and how the Internet of Things
will be affected by security issues in the future, when everything is
interconnected.
