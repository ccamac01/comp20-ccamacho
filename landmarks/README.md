Assignment 2 - Landmarks

1) I have correctly implemented the Google Maps API and can display the 
unique marker for the user that displays an info window with the login
and nearby landmark with distance. When the page is loaded, the markers
of all the people who have logged onto the server are displayed in their
respective location, along with an info window containing their login and
distance from the unique user (me, in this case). The landmarks nearby only
pop up in the map if they are within a mile radius. They display an info 
window with all of their information (if available). I was not able to 
correctly display the landmark information because it appears either
the JSON file was not parsed correctly or there are certain information
sections that some landmarks do not contain. Other than that, everything
else in the homework assignment should be implemented already.

2) I have only discussed this assignment with Jesus Garcia. We talked about
the correct libraries/API necessary to collect information for the geolocation.

3) I spent approximately 10-12 hours completing this assignment, most of the 
time was used to learn about features that needed to be implemented. I spent
at least 3 hours finding bugs in my code that would stop my entire program.
