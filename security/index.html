<ul>
<li><span class = "underline">Introduction</span> - Provide a description of the product and what
  you were hired to do: <p>I was hired to discover any vulnerabilities
  in a web application that collects a user's data, including their login name
and their location (latitude and longitude). After finding vulnerabilities,
I exploited them in order to determine the significance of the vulnerability
on the security of the application. It is my job to report back about these
discoveries and advise my employer on security measures and future practices
to prevent similar exploits.</p></li>
<li><span class = "underline">Methodology</span> - Describe your methodology pen testing the
  application, including the tools that you used:<p>In order to pen test the
  application, I tested the application step-by-step with methods such as
cross-site scripting. By purposedly submitting malicious responses on the user
interface, I was able to disrupt the application and gain control of certain
 aspects. These attacks were made possible by using curl to POST the data to the
server of the web application. By changing the "login" value to a script, the
web page interpreted the string as JS and executed the commands. Another method
I used, was NoSQL injection. By taking advantage of the GET requests in the URL,
I was able to submit a MongoDB command (the web app runs on MongoDB) as a value
for the database which was read as a command rather than a string value. For
example, I used the [$ne] attribute (not equal to) to compare a value to all the
values in the database. The command allowed the database to return all documents
that were not equal to the login that I used. This gave me access to the entire
contents of the database.</p></li>
<li><span class = "underline">Abstract of Findings</span> - Provide an overview of all the security
   and privacy issues you identified.  This section should be written for
   non-technical managers who do not have technical expertise and do not have
   time to read the entire document.  Write this section using lay language.
   <p>After taking a look at your web application, I noticed that any user could
   easily take over certain functionalities that they should not have access to.
 For example, they can manipulate your web pages to display anything they would
like. By submitting a chunk of code as a "login", the computer runs the code when
it interprets the "login" information, giving your user access the page.
 Most importantly, they can easily access all of your user's data through
another method in which they trick the database thinking it is receiving a
command rather than data values submitted by the average user.</p>
 </li>
<li><span class = "underline">Issues Found</span> - For each issue that you find, document:


<ul>
<li class = "issue">1) Issue: Input was not santized/filtered and allowed the user to send scripts
as input for login. This gave the user access to certain features of the app
they shouldn't have.</li>
<li>Location: This was found when sending a POST request to the page. By sending
the correct queries, a user was able to load JavaScript within the HTML of the
page.</li>
<li>Severity of issue: I think this issue is of high severity. The reason being
that the queries allow JavaScript to be executed on the page without the host's
permission. The JS can give the user access to the login/location information
of all the users. This invades the privacy of all the users, and thus, should
be a top priority.</li>
<li>Description of issue.  How did you find it?  A screenshot of problem is
   excellent.</li>

</p>
<li>Resolution: This issue can be resolved by sanitizing user input. For example,
filter out any special characters in a user's input to prevent any tags being used
to run scripts within the HMTL.</li>
</ul>

  <ul>
  <li class = "issue">2) Issue: GET input via URL was not sanitized (query) and allowed the user to
    submit values that were MongoDB commands. This gave the user access to
  the entire contents of the database.</li>
  <li>Location: This was found when sending a query value for login in the URL
    bar (GET request). By sending the correct queries, a user was able to load
  control the database and collect the data (all login information).</li>
  <li>Severity of issue: I think this issue is of high severity. The reason being
  that the user gained access to everything on the database. The commands sent
  via GET request in the URL bar, allow the user to manipulate the database.
  This example allowed access to everything saved on the database. This should
be your number one security concern. </li>
  <li>Description of issue.  How did you find it?  A screenshot of problem is
     excellent.</li>
     <p>If you take a look at the link below, it will redirect you to the image
     with the proof of this exploit. If you zoom into the URL bar, you will be
   able to see the command and where it was executed to exploit this vulnerability.</p>
  <li>Proof of vulnerability.  Show pictures or it didn't happen.</li>
<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/154226372@N07/38875422301/in/dateposted-public/" title="MongoDB Exploit"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4536/38875422301_bfb09fb27a_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1280" alt="MongoDB Exploit"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</p>
<li>Resolution: This issue can be resolved by validating the data passed to the
MongoDB. Either validate manually by parsing the string of special characters or
any phrases that may send commands to the database. This can also be done with
libraries that can do the work for you. For example, <a href = "https://github.com/hapijs/joi">Joi</a>
can lower the risk of attacks. To deploy it on Express, you can use
<a href = "https://github.com/continuationlabs/celebrate">Celebrate</a> access
these libraries/tools. WARNING: These libraries do not guarantee safety, they decrease
the risk of attack. You must take every step possible to prevent malicious hackers
from exploiting your application and causing damage. </li>
  </ul>

<ul>
<li class = "issue">3) Issue: A mix of both cross-site scripting and database
injection. By sending a script with a closing tag to the list tag, the script
is run when your code tries to read everything from the database during the
GET request /checkins.json.</li>
<li>Location: This was found when sending a query via curl that was later
executed by the database itself.</li>
<li>Severity of issue: This issue is of medium severity and would only occur
in the case that you are already protected from cross-site scripting in the
POST section of your server-side. The query is saved as a value in the database
and is executed when your GET function prints the database values to the screen.</li>

</p>
<li>Resolution: This vulnerability can be prevented by following the solutions
to the previous vulnerabilities. By validating all user input/data carefully,
you will minimize the risk of attack in these forms.</li>
</ul>
</li>


<li><span>Conclusion</span> - You can also list future considerations and
  recommendations with costs.
  <p>Overall, the vulnerabilities that I discovered with your web application
  are pretty severe. You must take action to patch these security issues in order
to provide a safe and secure experience for all of your users. I recommend you
test every single functionality you add to your application by exploring any
vulnerabilities that may arise. ALWAYS test your functionalities involving
input from the user. NEVER trust the user and their input.</p>
