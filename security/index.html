<ul>
<li><span class = "underline">Introduction</span> - Provide a description of the product and what
  you were hired to do: <p>I was hired to discover any vulnerabilities
  in a web application that collects a user's data, including their login name
and their location (latitude and longitude). After finding vulnerabilities,
I exploited them in order to determine the significance of the vulnerability
on the security of the application. It is my job to report back about these
discoveries and advise my employer on security measures and future practices
to prevent similar exploits.</p></li>
<li><span class = "underline">Methodology</span> - Describe your methodology pen testing the
  application, including the tools that you used:<p>In order to pen test the
  application, I tested the application step-by-step with methods such as
cross-site scripting. By purposedly submitting malicious responses on the user
interface, I was able to disrupt the application and gain control of certain
 aspects. These attacks were made possible by using curl to POST the data to the
server of the web application. By changing the "login" value to a script, the
web page interpreted the string as JS and executed the commands. Another method
I used, was NoSQL injection. By taking advantage of the GET requests in the URL,
I was able to submit a MongoDB command (the web app runs on MongoDB) as a value
for the database which was read as a command rather than a string value. For
example, I used the [$ne] attribute (not equal to) to compare a value to all the
values in the database. The command allowed the database to return all documents
that were not equal to the login that I used. This gave me access to the entire
contents of the database.</p></li>
<li><span class = "underline">Abstract of Findings</span> - Provide an overview of all the security
   and privacy issues you identified.  This section should be written for
   non-technical managers who do not have technical expertise and do not have
   time to read the entire document.  Write this section using lay language.
  <p>Findings go here.</p>
 </li>
<li><span class = "underline">Issues Found</span> - For each issue that you find, document:


<ul>
<li class = "issue">1) Issue: Input was not santized/filtered and allowed the user to send scripts
as input for login. This gave the user access to certain features of the app
they shouldn't have.</li>
<li>Location: This was found when sending a POST request to the page. By sending
the correct queries, a user was able to load JavaScript within the HTML of the
page.</li>
<li>Severity of issue: I think this issue is of high severity. The reason being
that the queries allow JavaScript to be executed on the page without the host's
permission. The JS can give the user access to the login/location information
of all the users. This invades the privacy of all the users, and thus, should
be a top priority.</li>
<li>Description of issue.  How did you find it?  A screenshot of problem is
   excellent.</li>
<li>Proof of vulnerability.  Show pictures or it didn't happen.</li>
<li>Resolution.  Make recommendation(s) on how issue can be resolved.
  Show code if possible.</li>
</ul>

  <ul>
  <li class = "issue">2) Issue: GET input via URL was not sanitized (query) and allowed the user to
    submit values that were MongoDB commands. This gave the user access to
  the entire contents of the database.</li>
  <li>Location: This was found when sending a query value for login in the URL
    bar (GET request). By sending the correct queries, a user was able to load
  control the database and collect the data (all login information).</li>
  <li>Severity of issue: I think this issue is of high severity. The reason being
  that the user gained access to everything on the database. The commands sent
  via GET request in the URL bar, allow the user to manipulate the database.
  This example allowed access to everything saved on the database. This should
be your number one security concern. </li>
  <li>Description of issue.  How did you find it?  A screenshot of problem is
     excellent.</li>
  <li>Proof of vulnerability.  Show pictures or it didn't happen.</li>
  <li>Resolution.  Make recommendation(s) on how issue can be resolved.
    Show code if possible.</li>
  </ul>

<ul>
<li class = "issue">3) Issue: (e.g., database injection, really bad programming practice)</li>
<li>Location or page where issue was found</li>
<li>Severity of issue (e.g., low, medium , or high).  Justify your answer.</li>
<li>Description of issue.  How did you find it?  A screenshot of problem is
   excellent.</li>
<li>Proof of vulnerability.  Show pictures or it didn't happen.</li>
<li>Resolution.  Make recommendation(s) on how issue can be resolved.
  Show code if possible.</li>
