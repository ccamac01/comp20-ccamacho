1) I was able to collect the information input by the user into the text box
and display it in the "log" section of the page in order from recent to old
messages. I was able to save the data by using the localStorage object to
save the data on the local machine. I could not, however, get the data to
print/stay on the screen when the page was refreshed. Even though, the data
did not stay on the page, it stayed in the local storage. I tested this out
by printing the localStorage.length() every time I entered a value, even after
refreshing the page. I also did not implement the timestamp to the messages
being input. 

2) I collaborated with Jesus Garcia on this lab. We talked about different 
online resources that were useful in learning more about jQuery and useful
articles/forums related to the assignment and objectives.

3) I spent about 4 hours completing the assignment and learning about the
necessary tools to complete the assignment with the time permitted.
